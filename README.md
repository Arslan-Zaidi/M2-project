## Description of folders:

- **Data_files**: Folder contains all the data files needed to run all the analyses

- **Filtering_heteroplasmies**: Filtering of heteroplasmies based on various criteria as listed in Fig. S3 from the manuscript.

- **Mutation_spectrum**: Code and .rmd file showing how the mutation spectrum was analyzed.

- **Denovo_mutation_analysis**: Heuristic identification of germline and somatic denovo mutations, and analysis of the effect of age on accumulation of these mutations.
